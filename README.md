Software Engineering Lab Project - Kacchi Restaurant Management System
🍛 Kacchi Khacchi - A Love Story in Every Byte! ❤️
Born from our obsession with Narayanganj's legendary Kacchi! As true Kacchi lovers, we've turned our passion into code - creating a digital feast that brings the same joy to ordering as that first aromatic bite!

This isn't just another restaurant website; it's our heart served on a digital platter 🥘. Every line of code is seasoned with the same love our grandmothers put into their secret recipes. We've blended traditional flavors with modern tech because great Kacchi deserves a great ordering experience!

From late-night coding sessions fueled by Kacchi cravings to designing interfaces that feel as warm as freshly steamed rice - this project is our love letter to every Kacchi enthusiast in Narayanganj!

Because some cravings aren't just hunger - they're emotions waiting to be served! ✨

Tech with taste, code with compassion - that's the Kacchi Khacchi promise!
